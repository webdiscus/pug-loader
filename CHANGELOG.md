# Change log

## 2.11.0 (2024-02-16)

  the loader can still works with the Node 14.x >=, but we test only with Node >= 16.16
- feat: add support the version `14.x` of the `markdown-it` in filters
- feat: add new `mode` option. Use it instead of the DEPRECATED `method` option name.
- feat(DEPRECATION): the `method` option is renamed into `mode`.
  The `method` option can be used until the next major version.
- feat: add new names for new `mode` option: `compile`, `render`, `html`.
- feat(DEPRECATION): the `pug-compile`, `pug-render`, `pug-html` method/mode names are deprecated! 
  This method/mode names can be used until the next major version.
- fix: decode URL params
  For example: 
    from the query `partial.pug?render&text=Hello%20World%21`
    will be parsed the `text` parameter as `Hello World!`.
- fix: detecting correct error case by load built-in filter
- chore: remove DEPRECATION message when the `pug loader` is used with `html-webpack-plugin`, 
  for reasons of humanity the support of the `html-webpack-plugin` still stay.\
  For developers is recommended to use the modern powerful [pug-plugin](https://github.com/webdiscus/pug-plugin).
